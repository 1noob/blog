I&rsquo;m a full-stack software engineer. I&rsquo;m originally
from Guangdong, China. I owe much of my career to the Web
and Deep learning.

Graduated from Guangdong University of Finance and Economics with a major in Computer Science.

During my undergraduate studies, I was deeply immersed in ACM competitions, occasionally
working on web development and small projects related to deep learning.

After graduating, I applied for a master's program in computer science at Fudan University, but unfortunately, I did not pass the interview.
